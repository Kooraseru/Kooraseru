# CEG2050 - Lab Work
This repository is designated as part of Lab Work for CEG 2050 at Wright University.

Hi There! I'm Henry, a student at Wright University. This course work is part of my progress towards my BSCS degree.

As part of this course I will be working on creating mod-repositories for Balatro (a LUA-based online card game), along with continuing work on my Trello-Discord Cloud API.
